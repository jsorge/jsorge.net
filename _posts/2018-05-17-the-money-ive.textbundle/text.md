The money I've spent on [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=15614818) as my email provider is some of the best I've spent. I have 3 domains funneling there as well as all of my "legacy" email (iCloud & Gmail) landing there too. Having only 1 email account setup on all my devices is really great.

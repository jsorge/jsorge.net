I really like [this post](http://www.manton.org/2018/01/no-applause-for-retweets.html) from Manton Reece about how he's setting up micro.blog. I took analytics off my site (which were meager at best) because after posting something, Iâ€™d check the dashboard regularly. I don't want to be writing for the (nonexistent) numbers anymore.

I'm officially off the market! As of this Monday, June 29, I'm rejoining the team at zulily as an iOS engineer. Things have changed a wee bit since I left and instead of having one mobile team to handle the app's duties they have started implementing vertical "squads". So with all that said, I'll be on the Discover Squad. What that means exactly, I'm not sure. I'll start to find out on Monday!

It's going to be fun going back to a place where I already have many friends – and I've gotten to meet some of the newer folks over the past couple years of Xcoders meetings. I'm excited to take some of the good things I learned at Lyft and bring them back to zulily.

I'm excited to start this new chapter. Onward!

I participated in my second 9 pin no-tap tournament at Robin Hood Lanes
today. The format basically means that if you get 9 pins on your first
shot, it counts as a strike. I did this last time in April, and missed
the cut by 40 pins. Today, I did a lot better (211, 183, 208, 199) and
made the cut.

During the final round, you bowl 2 games and the totals of those 2 games
(with your league handicap) makes your score. My first game was a pretty
dismal 157. After that I thought my chances were gone. The second game,
though, I found a rhythm and struck on the opening 6 frames, finishing
with a 265. I ended up in 5th place and won \$35, for a cool \$5 profit!

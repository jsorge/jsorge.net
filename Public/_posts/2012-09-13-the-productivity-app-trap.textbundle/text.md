I’ve definitely felt more than a bit overwhelmed lately. I’m in a season
where there are lots of areas that I’m trying to learn things that seem
brand new to me in development from Objective-C to CSS to MultiMarkdown
and general scripting. I’ve found lots of new resources for productivity
tips and tricks and scripts, ways to tweak my workflows and be “more
efficient.” There is a downside to all of this, though: my brain has
felt really cluttered over the past few months.

I start digging in on a problem that leads to other things I don’t know
and pretty soon I’m 3 layers deep and trying to figure out regluar
expressions. That doesn’t seem like a recipe for success to me. Another
thing that is problematic is my proclivity to try out new apps. My
default is to at least look into most of the new apps that cross my way.

Instead of figuring out what I want my end result to be and working
backwards to the apps that will help me best accomplish those things, I
see how everyone else does it and lose sight of what I’m trying to do.

The newest example of this is text editors. At work, I started using a
text editor for doing code on our website when I took that job over.
Then I moved to Coda which is phenominal but then also wanted to start
using plain text instead of Evernote for my note taking. So I started
using [TextMate](http://macromates.com) (partly the fault of listening
to [Build and Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/)), and then tried
both [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com) and
[Chocolat](http://chocolatapp.com) before settling on Chocolat. The
maddening thing is that I don’t even know all of what a full text-editor
can do. I really want to learn because I’m enjoying it very much, but I
also think that I’m wasting the capabilities of such a full app.

All this as a setup for a post that I loved on Michael Schechter’s
wonderful [A Better Mess site.](http://bettermess.com/) The post is
called [The Error of The App
Mentality](http://bettermess.com/the-error-of-the-app-mentality/), and
part that struck me was right here:

As much as I love tinkering and using new things I often lose sight of
the bigger reason of why I’m investigating any given new thing. If it’s
merely because it’s new and shiny then I’m just going to muddy up the
waters of reasoning in my mind. If it’s something that could tie in with
my end goals and help me accomplish them, then pursuing the new thing is
worthwhile.

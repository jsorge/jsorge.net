In my searching I ran across [this old [@brentsimmons](https://micro.blog/brentsimmons) blog post](http://inessential.com/2015/02/05/uxkit_skepticism) which linked to [this header](https://github.com/brentsimmons/QSKit/blob/master/Classes/QSPlatform.h) that does exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Brent!

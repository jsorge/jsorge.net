Dave DeLong has [added a fifth chapter](https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/04/24/a-better-mvc-part-5-an-evolution/) to his Better MVC series. The whole thing is worth a read. I love how he explains his thought processes and how he's changed over the last several months of writing, speaking, and looking at Apple's examples.

I've been working with [Liz Marley](https://twitter.com/emarley) to create a podcast for the [Xcoders](https://xcoders.org) and we finally got our first episode out the door yesterday! Our hope is to record on a monthly basis and we'll be talking about all things Xcoders-related. As the two of us are primarily Seattle Xcoders that's where our focus will be to start. My hope is to branch out and talk Eastside and Vancouver BC as well!

You can subscribe to the feed directly at [https://xcoders.org/podcast.xml](https://xcoders.org/podcast.xml). Our submission to iTunes is currently pending and I'll update this post with that link when it gets approved.

If you have any questions, comments, or topics you think we should cover, please do drop us a line at <a href="mailto:info@seattlexcoders.org">info@seattlexcoders.org</a>

**[God Wants You to Complain
(Link)](http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/god-wants-you-to-complain)**

I love this reminder from the Psalms.

Personally, I suck at talking to God about everything that’s going on
good or bad. That was one of the things that I loved about Redemption
Groups at Mars Hill is that they have you write a psalm. I’m convicted
by this that my journaling especially isn’t focused enough as a series
of prayers to God of thanksgiving as well as groaning.

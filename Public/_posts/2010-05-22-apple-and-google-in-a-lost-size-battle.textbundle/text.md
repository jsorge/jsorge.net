**[Apple and Google in a LOST size
battle](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/hPfk8AzFRVI/)**

I really like this column comparing Apple and Google to the brothers
from LOST. I watched the android presentation today from Google, and
Iust admit that I love some of the things that Google is doing with
cloud computing. The notification that sends a map straight to your
device is great, and having your app data automtically sync to the cloud
is fantastic. I’m still bought into the Apple eco-system, but they can
really take some cues from Google when it comes to cloud computing. I’m
getting even more excited for WWDC for Apple to respond to all the shots
taken at them (and maybe take a couple of their own).

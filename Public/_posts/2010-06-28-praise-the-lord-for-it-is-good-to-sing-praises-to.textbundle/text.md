> Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is
> pleasant, and a song of praise is fitting. The LORD builds up
> Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. He heals the
> brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of
> the stars; he gives to all of them their names. Great is our Lord, and
> abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.

[iOS Performance tips you probably didn't know (from an ex-Apple engineer)](https://www.fadel.io/blog/posts/ios-performance-tips-you-probably-didnt-know/)

> A common anti-pattern is leaving UITableView/UICollectionView cell labels populated with their text content when these cells enter the reuse queue. It is highly likely that once the cells are recycled, the labelsâ€™ text value will be different, so storing them is wasteful.

I could have pulled a few more gems from this super helpful post by Rony Fadel, but this first one struck me off the bat. I don't know how many times I have kept text in a label when I perhaps didn't need to. I _also_ didn't know that the right place to nil-out text in reusable views (`UI{Table|Collection}ViewCell`) is not in their `prepareForReuse()` method but in the delegate's `didEndDisplaying` method instead.

In larger projects with many cell class types this may take some thinking on how to get the message across to a cell type of "time to reset any labels you have". I know if I were still at zulily this would be something that I'd work to get in place as soon as possible, as I did a lot of really hacky things to collection views in my time there ðŸ˜€

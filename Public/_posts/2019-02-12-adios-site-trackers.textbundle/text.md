A while back I got rid of Google Analytics for this website and [Taphouse's](https://taphouse.io) too. I also went and downloaded fonts that I could embed in the site to get rid of TypeKit. I thought that was it, but it turns out my monospace font was downloaded too. Thanks to [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) that's no longer the case.

Goodbye anything that can track you!

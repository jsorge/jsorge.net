I was happy to join [Caleb Wells](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdLepqjYyKF4e8vxBZGdEQ?app=desktop) on his podcast [A Swiftly Tilting Planet](https://anchor.fm/a-swiftly-tilting-planet/).  We chatted a lot about my story as an iOS engineer, what it's like to do that job at Lyft, and got even more excited for the coming WWDC. Plus a lot of community talk. It was a really good time talking with him.

This was my first time being on a podcast. I've mentioned to a few people that I wanted to start doing a podcast this year. I tried a couple things on my own that I haven't (and probably won't) release, so getting the message from Caleb was a huge honor. I honestly don't know if I'm going to listen to it or not â€“ I think the idea of listening to myself talk makes me more nervous than the recording did!

I hope you find the episode enjoyable and/or helpful in some way. And if there's any feedback on the content or other tips for future recordings I'm all ears.

I got a new TV this week. Out goes my trusty, very color accurate 30”
Toshiba CRT HDTV and in comes a ginormous, behemoth of a 50” Sony Grand
Wega rearprojection TV. This TV was a gift from a really good friend,
who got it from his neighbor. He gave it to me since it didn’t work at
the time, and even diagnosed the part that it needed to be fixed. \$80
and a couple hours later, it was fixed and ready to go.

I’m really digging this thing, and it’s my hope that I can use it to
bless people with hospitality even more. I’m planning on opening my
condo to friends for this Seahawks season, and hopefully there are many
movie nights and Rockband parties ahead.

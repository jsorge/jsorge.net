**[Link: 512 Pixels Titanium PowerBook
G4](http://512pixels.net/2013/06/omm-titanium-powerbook/)**

I wrote a post for 512 Pixels, run by good guy Stephen Hackett. His site
features lots of nerdery around Macs new and old.

The idea came to me last week and wouldnâ€™t go away. So I spent a few
hours researching the Titanium PowerBook G4 and this is what I came up
with. Enjoy!

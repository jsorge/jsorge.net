**[Link: 512 Pixels Titanium PowerBook

I wrote a post for 512 Pixels, run by good guy Stephen Hackett. His site
features lots of nerdery around Macs new and old.

The idea came to me last week and wouldn’t go away. So I spent a few
hours researching the Titanium PowerBook G4 and this is what I came up
with. Enjoy!

The Mariners made a fake script for the 1994 World Series and had Dave Niehaus call it. [This story is unbelievable and you have to hear the sound.](https://theathletic.com/569307/2018/10/05/fly-fly-away-the-story-behind-the-mariners-unforgettable-and-fake-world-series-triumph)

I really miss Dave. And Mariner playoff baseball.

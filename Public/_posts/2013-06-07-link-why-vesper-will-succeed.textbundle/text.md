**[Link: Why Vesper will
Succeed](http://www.trevormckendrick.com/on-why-vesper-will-succeed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=on-why-vesper-will-succeed)**

A new iPhone app was released today. That’s not big news, but the big
news is that three of the biggest names in the Apple sphere conspired to
bring it out.

I’ve seen some of the demos of Vesper and while it looks really cool, I
think that Trevor hits on the real reason it will be a success. These
guys are well known and the app is getting attention because of who they
are.

Please don’t hear me saying that its not well deserved, but rather
getting the word out on your app is just as important as making it
great.

Definitely give Trevor’s post a read.

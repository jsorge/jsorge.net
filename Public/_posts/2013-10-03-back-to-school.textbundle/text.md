Monday was my first day back at school. I’m going after a certificate from the University of Washington in iOS & Mac App Development. It’s going to take a school year to complete and consists of 1 class for the next 3 quarters. This first quarter focuses on Mac development.

If you’re interested, you can find my homework code on my Github account at [my Github page.](https://github.com/jsorge) I’ll probably post some updates through the program.

Last night we launched our new community group at the condo. We had 13
people show up, including my old coach (Jeff) and my new one (Ed) and
his wife. It was a really cool night of establishing what a community is
and what Iâ€™m supposed to do as the leader.

Best part of the night: After prayer and cheesecake we had some amazing
conversation. I definitely see God leading us to becoming a family who
is open and transparent with each other. Hopefully that will also grow
us as a group and keep the movement going.

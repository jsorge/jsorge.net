Last night I gave my first Xcoders talk (and first tech talk in general), going over how I’ve brought CloudKit into Scorebook. The response was overwhelmingly positive from the group and I’m really happy about that. The talk had most all of the content that I’ve written so far in this series, but also went pretty in depth on CloudKit in general and has my upload and download processes as well as lots of code samples.

Some notes:

* I’m bummed that I haven’t shipped the Scorebook update yet, but I’m planning to in the next month or at the latest by the end of July.
* I didn’t talk about the user switching things from my [last post](http://jsorge.net/2015/06/09/scorebook-sync-log-08-user-switching/). Mostly because I haven’t finished the implementation and I didn’t want to talk about it in that state. I’ll keep writing about it here as I make progress though.

There was video recorded as well, and once that is posted to the Xcoders Vimeo account I’ll be sure to update this post with a link to it.

Update: [Here is the video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/156185164)

Lastly, I love talking about this stuff. If you have questions hit me up on [Twitter or via email](http://jsorge.net/about/).

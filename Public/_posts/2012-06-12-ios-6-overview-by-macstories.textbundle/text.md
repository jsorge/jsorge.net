**[iOS 6 Overview by
Macstories](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-6-our-complete-overview/)**

Great coverage by macstories on the new iOS 6:

> drastically revolutionizing the experience we are accustomed to.

I think this summarizes why I have mixed feelings about iOS 6. I really
was hoping for better inter-app communication, improvements to
notification center and a more updated UI. I have no doubt that iOS 6 is
a big improvement (especially with Siri coming to iPad and Maps getting
overhauled), but I had my hopes up for a bit more.

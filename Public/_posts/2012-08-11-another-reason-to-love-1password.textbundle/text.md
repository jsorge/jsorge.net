A couple weeks ago I changed my 1Password master password to something
longer and more secure. What I didn’t do was make sure that sync to my
iPhone and iPad didn’t break. Today I created a new account on the iPad
that I wanted to use on the iPhone and it didn’t show up. I got a little
scared when 1Password made me reset my sync. Thinking that I would lose
the new account I copied the password to my clipboard as a safety.

How wrong I was!

The sync was flawless and I lost nothing. If you don’t have 1Password,
you’re missing out.

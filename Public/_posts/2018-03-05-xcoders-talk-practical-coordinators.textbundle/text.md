title: 'Xcoders Talk: Practical Coordinators'

Last November I gave a talk at the [Seattle Xcoders](http://seattlexcoders.org) meetup about the coordinator pattern. There’s been a lot of virtual ink spilled on the topic of design patterns and the coordinator pattern specifically. I’ve been using it in a refactor of a side project app as well as using it pretty heavily at [zulily](https://www.zulily.com) in some of the new projects I had been doing.

I got inspired to give the talk after last year’s [Swift by Northwest](https://swiftbynorthwest.com) conference, where [Dave DeLong](https://davedelong.com/blog/2017/11/06/a-better-mvc-part-1-the-problems/) gave a really great talk about improving MVC. He has a different take on coordinators than I do and his solution is really interesting. But I like where I’ve landed with coordinators for the time being personally.

I decided to put a little different spin on this talk than I’ve seen in other coordinator talks, and prepped a sample app that I would refactor. We go from storyboard segues to a coordinator handling the transition between two screens. There was a lot of live coding and it worked out pretty well. I hope it’s entertaining if not useful for you and I’d love to hear your thoughts on how it all turned out.

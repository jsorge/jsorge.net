I finally got a shortcut set up the way I want so that I can post to my site from iOS easily. A new update to iA Writer added the ability to browse a textbundle as a folder which is exactly what I need to get going.

This summer I hope to make lightweight editors for iOS and Mac (the Mac using Marzipan if itâ€™s good enough).

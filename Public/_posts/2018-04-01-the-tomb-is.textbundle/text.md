The tomb is empty, because Christ is risen. Happy Easter!

“The wrapping that had been on His head was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a separate place by itself. The other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, then entered the tomb, saw, and believed. For they still did not understand the Scripture that He must rise from the dead. (John 20:7-9, HCSB)”

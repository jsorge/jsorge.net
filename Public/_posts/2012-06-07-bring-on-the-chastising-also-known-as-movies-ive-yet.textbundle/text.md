People who know me know that I love movies.

Those who **really** know me know that I haven’t seen lots of the
classics, either.

I’m fully prepared to take whatever is thrown at me in terms of mocking,
criticism, etc but I’m thinking that a fun project this summer can be to
knock a good number of the movies that I haven’t seen off of that list.

That said, here’s the list that I’ve compiled so far. It’s in no
particular order:

-   UHF
-   Alien
-   Alens
-   Terminator
-   Terminator 2
-   Jaws
-   Commando
-   Total Recall (the orignal)
-   Time Bandits
-   Pitch Black
-   Rear Window

Ok let the mocking begin. But please, at the same time, provide any
other movies that you think I should see that (given the list above) I
probably haven’t.

Have at it!

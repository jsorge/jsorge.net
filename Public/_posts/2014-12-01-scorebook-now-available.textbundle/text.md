It's been a crazy last week for me, and in all the hubbub I neglected to post that Scorebook got approved and is available for sale!

I'm really excited to have it in the world, and I've gotten some great feedback thus far. I'd love it if you checked it out.

The Taphouse site is still being built out, so in the meantime here's the [App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scorebook-remember-your-games/id897584352).

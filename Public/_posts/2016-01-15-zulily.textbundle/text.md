For the past few months I’ve been contracted out to work at [zulily](https://www.zulily.com) in their mobile team. We are a group of 5 iOS, 4 Android, and 2 mobile API developers building out the mobile app experience for our customers. It’s a tall order, but a great team to work with and a fun environment to work in.

I’m happy to say that I have accepted an offer to join them full time as a senior iOS engineer, which means I will be leaving [General UI](http://jsorge.net/2015/07/19/im-hired-at-general-ui/), starting January 25. There’s a lot of challenges ahead, and fun features and tasks to tackle to make the app even better. We are working on a major new release that will bring some great new features to our customers.

I wasn’t at General UI for long but I’m so thankful for where they placed me, leading to starting this new chapter.   I met some great folks over there that I hope to keep in touch with, and I wish them nothing but the best.

I’m excited to see what the Lord will do with this new opportunity. He is faithful – always. I hope that he will use me at zulily however he pleases. And I can’t wait to be a part of it.

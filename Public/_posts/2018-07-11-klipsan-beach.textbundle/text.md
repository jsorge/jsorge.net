We spent the last weekend at [Klipsan Beach](http://klipsanbeachcottages.com), which is just a few minutes north of Long Beach, Washington. I’ve been coming here since I was a little kid, and my dad since he was a little kid. Now I’ve got little kids to bring and we’ve come every year since Atticus’s first summer in 2014.

We rent a cottage which has an ocean view (and just a few minute walk through the dunes). There’s a fun little farmers market in Ilwaco on Saturdays that we went to, then we spent some time in the town of Long Beach. On Sunday, Emily and I went golfing with Dad at Surfside just up the road in Ocean Park.

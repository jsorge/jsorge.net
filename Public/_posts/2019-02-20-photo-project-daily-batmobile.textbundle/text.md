A big part of the creative process is [showing up every day](https://shawnblanc.net/2015/04/how-to-show-up-every-day/), and that's one place I've fallen short many times over the years. It's super easy to start something, but seeing it through is another. This year I wanted to do a creative project that would challenge me to show up every day, and I found one.

When I got my new camera a while ago I read a blog post that gave a simple piece of advice to help shoot more: take a trinket with you. The idea is to photograph it in many different settings, and being mindful of wanting to take more pictures encourages you to learn your camera and think about how you can frame the next shot. My wonderful wife got me a Hot Wheels Batmobile for me to carry around, but I didn't do much with it at the time.

I decided this year to take on the creative project of shooting a photo a day with my Batmobile and I'm pleased to report that I've shown up every day this year. Some are better than others (which is to be expected!) and a couple have made me very happy with how they've come out.

Honestly I've gone back and forth deciding whether or not I want to share them. On the one hand, it's a fun project and I'm really enjoying it. On the other hand, I know my skills aren't fantastic and it opens me up to critique (and knowing the internet, possibly some sharp barbs along the way). But I've decided to go for it and share them because I want to get better and I want to hold myself accountable this year to deliver a photo every day.

I'll be posting my photos on an [iCloud shared album here](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0wJ0DiRHJ6Gv47). I would like a slightly better web presentation but this method is easy for me to publish from my Mac or iOS devices so that's the way I decided to go. I'm anxious to hear any feedback that you might have.

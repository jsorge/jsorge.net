I have launched my new website. If youâ€™ve been around here before you might not notice anything different (if youâ€™re a new reader â€“Â welcome! ðŸ‘‹). But I assure you, itâ€™s different.

I was running my site on [Ghost](https://ghost.org). And while it was great for me for the last few years I found it lacking lately (mostly I want to combine microblogging and full-length blogging). So I [decided to build my own engine](https://jsorge.net/2018/06/17/building-a-blog-engine).

I call it Maverick, and my ambitions for this project are pretty lofty. Itâ€™s not a finished product yet; far from it. But I realized that it was close enough to replace Ghost that I should just pull the trigger. [Real artists ship](http://www.creativethinkinghub.com/steve-jobs-was-right-real-artists-ship/), after all. In fact, this is the first thing Iâ€™ve shipped on my own since Scorebook back in November, 2014.

Maverick is powered by [Vapor](https://vapor.codes), which is a web framework written in Swift. This appealed to me on a few levels but the main one is that I already know Swift since Iâ€™m an iOS developer by trade. Not learning a whole new language is a big win for me (as Iâ€™ll explain in later posts there were several other things I had to learn to get here).

I started writing the intro post which went into some technical detail but realized that maybe Iâ€™d gone too far after 1100 words. So Iâ€™m going to go a different route and break things up into different posts. I wanted to get this inaugural post out there to commemorate the occasion.

If youâ€™re curious about Maverick, itâ€™s fully open source. Things are a little confusing, but there are 2 repos: the first is for the actual application, and the second is for my website. Iâ€™ll leave you with links to the two repos. Cheers!

Iâ€™m working on a project for Lyft that will bring in a new app extension to both our passenger and driver apps. The functionality between both apps is going to be identical so sharing code should be maximized. I am trying to figure out how to get it working to make just a single extension that can be used on both apps. This is more difficult than you might imagine, because [extensions can be fiddly](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2420/_index.html). They need to share the same version and build strings, and building in Xcode revealed this hidden gem:

> Embedded binary's bundle identifier is not prefixed with the parent app's bundle identifier.

Ugh. This begged the question of how I could possibly get it to work. Off to chase a snipe. Letâ€™s start with a [sample project](https://github.com/jsorge/shared-extension), shall we?

Iâ€™m no shell script wizard, but it seemed that a run script build phase should do the trick. It needs to run in the host app prior to anything else happening. This means itâ€™s the second build phase (dependencies always need to be built first). Hereâ€™s what I came up with:

```bash
#! /bin/sh

APPEX_DIR=$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/SharedExtension.appex
INFO_PLIST=$APPEX_DIR/Info.plist
suffix=richmessagenotification

if [ "$IS_EMPLOYEE" = YES ] ; then
bundleID=io.taphouse.EmployeeApp.$suffix
shortVersion=$VERSION_EMPLOYEE
version=$VERSION_EMPLOYEE.$BUILD_NUMBER_EMPLOYEE
else
bundleID=io.taphouse.CustomerApp.$suffix
shortVersion=$VERSION_CUSTOMER
version=$VERSION_CUSTOMER.$BUILD_NUMBER_CUSTOMER
fi

plutil -replace CFBundleIdentifier -string "$bundleID" $INFO_PLIST
plutil -replace CFBundleShortVersionString -string "$shortVersion" $INFO_PLIST
plutil -replace CFBundleVersion -string "$version" $INFO_PLIST
```

Iâ€™ve extracted out the short version and build values as build settings in each main app target and those get funneled into the script. In this sample Iâ€™ve hard-coded each appâ€™s bundle ID to prefix the extension, but at Lyft these are build settings as well[1]().

Iâ€™ve got a build setting in one of my apps indicating what kind of app it is (in this case that is the `IS_EMPLOYEE` setting). Checking that will tell me the environment the script is running in. I setup 3 variables for each app and replace their values in the extensionâ€™s _already built_ Info.plist file. This is important, because itâ€™s too late to change the file in my source directory.

So now Iâ€™ve got an Info.plist file with all the proper values. Each app will build and run in the simulator. ðŸŽ‰!

But we donâ€™t write apps for the simulator. We write them for phones. Letâ€™s give that a shot.

Dang. Looking at the build steps for my extension reveals that thereâ€™s a code signature step at the very end and changing the Info.plist afterwards seems to break that signature. So how do we get this done?

Well, I donâ€™t know. My best guess is that I might need to figure out how to re-sign the extension after manipulating its Info.plist. Is this possible? Reasonable to do?

What Iâ€™ll probably wind up doing is have individual extensions (one for each app) and a shared framework that backs each. I think it will be easier to get going and more resilient to changes in tooling in the future.

Unless youâ€™ve got a way for me to get this doneâ€¦ ðŸ™‚

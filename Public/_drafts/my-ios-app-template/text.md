A couple of weeks ago I started working on a new (seekrit) iOS project with a buddy. A couple of weeks _before that_ I started working on a different new little project. It seems that it's easy to start new things but oftentimes I find that when I go File -> New Project in Xcode I keep making some of the same changes over and over again. Additionally I've come to really like not relying on Xcode projects at all in source control.

So what did I do when I found myself in this situation? I automated it, of course! I want to start off with a shell project, generated by [Xcodegen](https://github.comn/yonaskolb/xcodegen), that can get me up and running quickly. I want the ability to add new modules to the project so I can keep things nicely organized and built in a modern way.

I've found myself in chats with other developers who want to get started in building apps this way

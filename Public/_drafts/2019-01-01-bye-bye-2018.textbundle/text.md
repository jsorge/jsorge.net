Today marks the start of 2019, and with it the promise of a new year. I haven't gotten around to wrapping up my thoughts on 2018 though so let's start the year by looking back. It was a busy, full year.

**Work**

My first year at Lyft marked the first time since 2013 I spent a whole calendar year at a company. Thinking about this kind of blows my mind. I got to work on some really fun projects which – oddly enough – were not directly related to the team I work(ed) on. I got to do a couple of tooling projects to help day-to-day life better for the whole iOS team. I haven't been to work since December 14 and will be going back on Thursday. When I do I'll be officially moving from the communications platform team to the driver onboarding team. There is a huge project coming up there that I'll be able to play a big part in getting finished. Onward!

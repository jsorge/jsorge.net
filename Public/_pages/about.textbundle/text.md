![Me](assets/avatar.jpg)

Hello! My name is Jared Sorge. I hail from the suburbs of Seattle, WA where I live with my wife Emily and two sons: Atticus and Finnian. I'm a follower of Jesus, who gives me my identity. By trade I'm an iOS developer, with my day job at Lyft and a few various side projects.

If you want to know what I'm working on right now, check out my [handy /now page](http://jsorge.net/now)!

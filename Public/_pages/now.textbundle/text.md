*updated 3/11/2019*

### Lyft
* I've been at Lyft since December, 2017.
* I spent year 1 on the communications platform team doing behind the scenes work that you probably wouldn't notice.
* I joined the Driver Onboarding team in January and am gearing up to launch my first new feature as part of that team: a new driver license scanning workflow.

### Other Projects
* [Scorebook](https://taphouse.io/scorebook) has returned to the app store, and I'll be keeping it updated regularly.
* [Maverick](https://github.com/jsorge/maverick) is the blog engine powering this site, and I've got a few things I still want to do to enhance it. Mostly this isn't directly Maverick related but more around tooling for writing posts on iOS and the Mac.
* I'm co-organizing the [Seattle Xcoders](https://xcoders.org) meetup group.


### Home
* Atticus (5) is in preschool, and will be going in to developmental kindergarten in the fall.
* Finnian (2.5) will be going in to part-time preschool in the fall.
* Both boys are super busy and fun, giving my wife and me lots of joy along the way.

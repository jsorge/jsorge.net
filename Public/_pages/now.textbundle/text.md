### Zulily
* I'm on the Core Site & Apps (CSA) squad as an iOS Engineer
* My projects lately have been largely focused on our Jenkins CI infrastructure recently
* I've also been working on rebuilding parts of our codebase to be more modern and easier to use – starting with analytics.

### Other Projects
* [Scorebook](https://taphouse.io/scorebook) has been languishing a bit. I want to come back to it and rebuild it in SwiftUI.
* [Maverick](https://github.com/jsorge/maverick) is the blog engine powering this site, and I've got a few things I still want to do to enhance it. Mostly this isn't directly Maverick related but more around tooling for writing posts on iOS and the Mac.
* I've been working on a new app which is part of the Maverick support effort but is a bit more generalized to be something usable by more people.
* I have a client that I've been working with for a few months where I'm helping to build out and maintain their CI infrastructure (Bitrise & GitHub Actions).
* I'm co-organizing the [Seattle Xcoders](https://xcoders.org) meetup group.
    * I also do [our podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/xcoders/id1470146564)!

### Home
* Atticus (7.5) is in 2nd grade.

It will likely be some git repo or perhaps a Dropbox synced folder but all of the options that I‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt strongly link a post together with assets. Textbundle solves that.<\/p>\n<p>I think initially I might wrap Jekyll in something, so that the thing making the static site is really an implementation detail. The idea being that my server has an endpoint that would accept XML-RPC as well as micropub inputs, transform those to a textbundle and then build the static site from there.<\/p>\n<p>So my first step was to download my posts stored on Ghost as well as my assets folder. I wanted a way to build textbundles out of these for easy migration. My first inclination was a Ruby script. I don‚Äôt know Ruby, so that became problematic from the start. So I turned to a more familiar language.<\/p>\n<p>I made a Swift package called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jsorge\/textbundleify\">textbundleify<\/a>, and the code is up on GitHub if you‚Äôre interested. It‚Äôs not polished in the slightest, but was a fun chance to try something new. It gets run from a directory containing Markdown files and if you give it a directory that contains pictures (or a directory of directories of pictures), it will embed linked images to the referenced textbundle.<\/p>\n<p>I had to learn to use <code>Process<\/code> as well as <code>NSRegularExpression<\/code> (though I still don‚Äôt know how regular expressions really work). It was quite weird getting an <code>NSRange<\/code> for use on a Swift string, which only works on <code>String.Range<\/code> ranges. It was fun to put together over a few hours, and should do the migration trick I‚Äôm wanting.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to figure out the proper order of operations in converting textbundles (which Jekyll doesn‚Äôt support) to the structure that Jekyll does.

We‚Äôve been led astray by Apple. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, iOS is great. I love writing code in Swift (and Objective-C!). I‚Äôm a fan of Xcode too. And UIKit really makes a lot of really powerful things quite easy. But allow me this hot take: View controllers should never have to deal with navigation.<\/p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a long running joke about MVC actually standing for <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/?q=massive+view+controller&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=qa\">massive view controllers<\/a> and navigation is a key reason. Even a relatively simple view controller with a couple of possible destinations, using storyboards and segues, needs to implement methods that could grow to be dozens of lines long and end up knowing about the implementation details of view controllers that come after them.<\/p>\n<p>What are we to do? There must be some way that can keep our view controllers clean of navigation <em>and<\/em> doesn‚Äôt fight the UIKit frameworks completely, right?<\/p>\n<p>There is!<\/p>\n<p>If we treat view controllers like functional pieces, we can expose a small interface to interact with them and use delegation to get stuff out. Here‚Äôs a trivial example:<\/p>\n<pre><code>protocol PeopleViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {\n    func personSelected(_ person: Person, from viewController: PeopleViewController)\n}\n\nfinal class PeopleViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate {\n    var delegate: PeopleViewControllerDelegate?\n    private var people: [People]?\n\n    func configureWithPeople(_ people: [Person]) {\n        self.people = people\n        \/\/ fill a table with people\n    }\n\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\n        \/\/ find the person\n        self.delegate?.personSelected(person, from: self)\n    }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This view controller (while grossly incomplete) gets configured with an array of people that will fill a table view. Tap on a row and the view controller‚Äôs job is done. It hands off the person to its delegate. What happens next is out of its hands. Perhaps we‚Äôll show a detail screen, but maybe it‚Äôs just an API call and this view controller gets dismissed. Our <code>PeopleViewController<\/code> doesn‚Äôt know, and doesn‚Äôt care. Kind of great, right?<\/p>\n<p>This begs the question of <em>what<\/em> exactly is the delegate? I‚Äôve come to really like the <a href=\"http:\/\/khanlou.com\/2015\/01\/the-coordinator\/\">coordinator pattern<\/a> myself. I like having objects whose specific responsibility it is to manage the flow of my app (or just a given object‚Äôs slice of the app).<\/p>\n<p>There are some things that you‚Äôll have to give up, of course. Storyboard segues are a non-starter in this pattern. This means that there are large swaths of sample code (Apple‚Äôs and others‚Äô) that you‚Äôll need to learn to either ignore or translate into this pattern.<\/p>\n<p>So let‚Äôs trim down the size of our view controllers. Let‚Äôs narrow their scopes of responsibility, and in turn we‚Äôll get code that is more maintainable and easier to reason about. I think we will all be better off.<\/p>\n","url":"http:\/\/jsorge.local\/2018\/05\/02\/view-controllers-make-crummy-navigators"},{"id":"http:\/\/jsorge.local\/2018\/05\/02\/the-only-reason","url":"http:\/\/jsorge.local\/2018\/05\/02\/the-only-reason","content_html":"<p>The only reason it's not insane for parents to pick up after their kids day after day after day is that they don't expect different results.<\/p>\n"},{"id":"http:\/\/jsorge.local\/2018\/05\/02\/reminder-to-my","url":"http:\/\/jsorge.local\/2018\/05\/02\/reminder-to-my","content_html":"<p>Reminder to my future self: setting the <code>delegate<\/code> property on a <code>UINavigationController<\/code> subclass doesn't always do what I think it will do.
